## About The Project

![Clubest Image](https://i.imgur.com/Rvs2wNz.png)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

### Built With
The technologies we used to built the app are:
* [Asp .Net Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
* [MS SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019)
