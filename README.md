## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Nowadays, there is no easy way for people to find places where they can enjoy their hobbies and interests. It could be playing guitar, learning new skill or just playing sport for fun you will have hard time finding people and place for your activity.

- IDEAL: All people who want to enjoy there hobbies and find the most suitable place for them.
- REALITY: People struggle to find start their side activities, so they search in social media and in most cases they can even give up there passion for new activities.
- CONSEQUENCES: There are more people who actually want to do something different but they don't know where to find it.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
We have managed to figure out a solution for this problem. A platform which ease the process of searching and joining clubs. It is made in a way that allows both club owners and participants to get all functionalities they need in one place. For example: organizing events, conducting polls, communicating and making new friends. Clubest make all those functionalities possible and users should no longer rely on social media.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
Add more functionalities and ease the process. Adding google maps and so on.
